This repository is intended to provide a (not necessarily complete) collection of structural multiple sequence alignments of evolutionary conserved RNA structures in viruses. Currently, specific ecologic groups of flaviviruses are covered.

Each alignment of viral sequences represents a particular RNA family of structurally homologous entities and has been built either from known RNA families or derived de-novo by comparative genomics. All alignments are in Stockholm format, which allows easy construction of [Infernal](http://eddylab.org/infernal/) covariance models.

While some of the alignments are also available though the [Rfam](https://rfam.xfam.org) database, several alignments provided here have been specifically built for particular viral species or groups. This allows for a fine-grained characterization and comparison of conserved RNA elements in different viruses, as outlined in the below publications.
